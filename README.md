# Refactored-Code-w-checksum
Generated an appropriate self-signed certificate using Java Keytool. Deployed and implemented the cryptographic hash algorithm by refactoring code, while demonstrating functionality with a checksum verification.


Assignment summary

In this scenario Artemis Financial was the client, and they wanted me to address the issue of file verification and secure access. For this, I started by running a Maven vulnerability check, I then implemented SHA256 and verified the hash, after that, I implemented the certificate into spring framework to enforce HTTPS. This is not only important for securing access, but also for the company's reputation. The hardest part of the assignment was trying to get the browser to accept the SSL certificate. I believe I will continue to use maven dependency checks in the future to secure applications, this allows me to research each vulnerability to decide if its a false positive or something more serious for me to consider. With these tests, I could do further checks after I've patched a given vulnerability, allowing me to check my work. I think this assignment could show my commitment and understanding of correct coding practices and proper encryption/certificate handling.
